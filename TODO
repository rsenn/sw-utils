  - packages like daemontools, bash, etc. should provide hooks (shell scripts)
    which are put into /usr/local/lib/pkgmk and which are able to handle a
    specific type of function within a package file. (services, completions,
    etc.)

  - pkgmk should detect if the package which is to be built was already
    released. in this case it MUST increment the release number and inform the
    developer about it.
